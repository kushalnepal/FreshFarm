| Feature           | Endpoint                  | Middleware                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| User Login        | `/auth/login`             | ErrorHandler                                  |
| User Signup       | `/auth/signup`            | ErrorHandler                                  |
| Create Product    | `/products/createproduct` | AuthMiddleware, AdminMiddleware, ErrorHandler |
| Delete Product    | `/products/:id`           | AuthMiddleware, AdminMiddleware, ErrorHandler |
| Get Product by ID | `/products/:id`           | AuthMiddleware, AdminMiddleware, ErrorHandler |
| List Products     | `/products/`              | AuthMiddleware, AdminMiddleware, ErrorHandler |
